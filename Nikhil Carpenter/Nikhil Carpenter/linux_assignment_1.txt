1)LINUX allows users to have files which are not listed, by default, by the ls command.
These are called hidden files and are distinguishable from other files by the fact that their filenames begin with a dot (.).
Such a file is .profile which is executed every time you log in to the system.
Hidden files are listed by adding the -a option to the ls command.

2)mkdir -p A/B/C

3)Cat command can be used to display the content of a file,
copy content from one file to another, 
concatenate the contents of multiple files, display the line number.
on the other hand, Tac command will display the file content in reverse order.
It prints the last line first, then second last and so on.
Such way, it prints the first line at last.
