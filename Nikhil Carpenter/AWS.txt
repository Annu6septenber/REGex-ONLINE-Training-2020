1-First, create a new instance by creating new access file, call it 'helper' instance with same region and VPC as of the lost pem file instance.

2-Now stop the lost pem file instance. Remember not to terminate instance but to stop it.

3-Go to EBS volumes, select the root volume of the lost pem file instance and detach.

4-Now again select the detached volume and this time you have to attach this volume to helper instance which we created before. 
  Since helper instance already has a root volume by default as /dev/sda1, the newly attached volume will be secondary(eg: /dev/sdf).

5-Login to your helper instance with its pem file.

6-Execute below commands:
	# mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt
	# cp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /mnt/root/.ssh/
	# umount /mnt
7-Detach the secondary volume from helper instance.

8-Again attach the volume back to our recovery instance. Start the instance. Terminate the helper instance.

Use helper instance pem file to log into recovery instance.
