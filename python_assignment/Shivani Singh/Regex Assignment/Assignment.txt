       LINUX                                                  ASSIGNMENT-1

 1. when we create a user, some hidden files are generated in the directory of the same user at that time. How is it done?
Ans:-Because this files are in the folder /etc/skel/ and which files we place in this folder those files will be made available in the home directory
     of all the users which we create afterward.
     Some Commands to create a file are:
            touch testfile
            useradd Redhatuser
 2. Make subdirectories inside a parent directory by using single mkdir command.(Given fig.)
Ans:-mkdir ; parent directory ....A/B/C
 3. tac command vs cat command.
Ans:-tac command is used to concatenate and print files in reverse, and the cat command which is one of the most frequently used command allows us to 
     to create single or multiple files,concatenate files and redirect output in terminal or files.

                                                        ASSIGNMENT-2

 1. Change the Umask value for any user permanently.
Ans:- Go to /etc /profile and go to line no 62
      change the Umask value whichever you want
      Save  and then exit file.
 2. Add a new user without using adduser & useradd command.
Ans:-Add a entry for the user in /etc /passwd file;
     Add a entry for the group in /etc/group file;
     Create the home directory for the dder user and set the new user passwd using the passwd command. 
 3. Can we change the Umask value to 0888.If yes then how,if not then why?
Ans:-No, we can't change the Umask value to 0888 because if we use it then by default permission for file and directory go to negative and less than
     0 that is not possible.
 4. How to add a new user with a unique user id(e.g 1345) & check out the unique Id of that user?
Ans:-Useradd;
     To check unique Id of that particular user;
     Go to VIM/etc/passwd
 5. HOw to change the group of any folder; (a)after this heckout the group name of the files present in that folder.
                                           (b)Try to change the group of the folder and the files present in the same folder using a single command.
Ans:-(a)-To check the groupname of the files in the folder
          #11 file /folder
     (b)- chowm  -R:
          groupname   parentdirectory
              R for recursively

                                                      ASSIGNMENT-3

 1. Create & compress the file with bzip2.
Ans:- #tar -cvzf contentFile.tar.bz2 content.txt.
 2. What should be the argument to be given to unzip that file?
Ans:- #bzip2 -d filename.bz2 
             (-d for decompess).
 3. Read a file & show the data on terminal using file input & output redirection.
Ans:- #cat < file.
 4. How to change the shell of user to "/bin/sh" at the time of adding the user?
Ans:- 3useradd  -s  /bin/sh   username. 


   PYTHON                                             ASSIGNMENT 1


 1. What is JPython and CPython?
Ans-JPython:-JPython is an implementation of the Python programming language designed to run on the Java platform.JPyhthon is extremely useful because
    it provides the productivity features of a mature scripting language while running on a JVM.
    CPython:-Reference implementation of Python is called CPython which is written in C language.CPython compiles your python code into bytecode and 
    interprets that bytecode in a evaluation loop.CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the language.

 2. Basic difference between Python2 and Python3.
Ans-                     Python2:-                                                                   Python3

      # It is the more stable and transparent version of the Pyhton         # It is  of the future of python designed to address the design
        programming language.                                                 flaws in the previous versions.
      # The print syntax is treated as a statement rather than a            # The print is explicity traeted as a function and replaced by 
        function which requires text to be wrapped in parenthesis.            the print() function in pyhton3 which requires an extra pair 
      # ASCII string type is used by default to store string.                 of parenthesis.
      # It simply return an integer to the nearest whole number when        # Unicode is the implict string type by default.
        dividing two integers.                                              # It males integer division more intuitive by using true division
      # In python2, the xrange() is used for iterations.                      for integer and floats.
                                                                            # In python3, the range() function to perform iterations.


 3. Difference between ASCII & Unicode.
Ans-                     ASCII                                                                    UNICODE 
      # Stands for American Standard code for Information Interchange.      # Stands for Universal character Set.
      # It supports 128 characters.                                         # It supports a wide range of character.
      # Uses 7 bits to represent a character.                               # Uses 8 bit, 16 bit, and 32 bit depending on the encoding type
      # It requires less space.                                             # It requires more space.
      # ASCII is not standardized.                                          # Unicode is standardized.
