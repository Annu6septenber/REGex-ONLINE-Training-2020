Ques 1. What is JPython & CPython?
Ans. Jython is a Python interpreter implemented in Java. It can be fully integrated into existing Java applications; 
     alternatively, Python applications can be compiled into a collection of Java classes. Python programs running on
     the Jython virtual machine have full access to the Java classes and APIs.

     CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C and Python, CPython is the
     default and most widely used implementation of the language. CPython can be defined as both an interpreter and a            compiler as it compiles Python code into bytecode before interpreting it. It has a foreign function interface with
     several languages including C, in which one must explicitly write bindings in a language other than Python.


Ques 2. Basic difference between Python2 & python3.
Ans. This is the most well-known change. In this, the print keyword in Python 2 is replaced by the print() function
     in Python 3.
     In Python 2 implicit str type is ASCII. But in Python 3 implicit str type is Unicode.
     Function take fata from the user (user_input) in the python 2, but in the python 3 (input()) fucntion is use.
     In python3 long is not supported 


Ques 3. Difference between ASCII & unicode.
Ans. ASCII defines 128 characters, which map to the numbers 0–127. Unicode defines (less than) 221characters, which,      similarly, map to numbers 0–221 (though not all numbers are currently assigned, and some are reserved).
     Unicode is a superset of ASCII, and the numbers 0–128 have the same meaning in ASCII as they have in Unicode. For      example, the number 65 means "Latin capital 'A'".
