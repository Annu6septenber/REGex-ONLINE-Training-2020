 1. What is JPython and CPython?
Ans-JPython:-JPython is an implementation of the Python programming language designed to run on the Java platform.JPyhthon is extremely useful because
    it provides the productivity features of a mature scripting language while running on a JVM.
    CPython:-Reference implementation of Python is called CPython which is written in C language.CPython compiles your python code into bytecode and 
    interprets that bytecode in a evaluation loop.CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the language.
 2. Basic difference between Python2 and Python3.
Ans-                     Python2:-                                                                   Python3

      # It is the more stable and transparent version of the Pyhton         # It is  of the future of python designed to address the design
        programming language.                                                 flaws in the previous versions.
      # The print syntax is treated as a statement rather than a            # The print is explicity traeted as a function and replaced by 
        function which requires text to be wrapped in parenthesis.            the print() function in pyhton3 which requires an extra pair 
      # ASCII string type is used by default to store string.                 of parenthesis.
      # It simply return an integer to the nearest whole number when        # Unicode is the implict string type by default.
        dividing two integers.                                              # It males integer division more intuitive by using true division
      # In python2, the xrange() is used for iterations.                      for integer and floats.
                                                                            # In python3, the range() function to perform iterations.


 3. Difference between ASCII & Unicode.
Ans-                     ASCII                                                                    UNICODE 
      # Stands for American Standard code for Information Interchange.      # Stands for Universal character Set.
      # It supports 128 characters.                                         # It supports a wide range of character.
      # Uses 7 bits to represent a character.                               # Uses 8 bit, 16 bit, and 32 bit depending on the encoding type
      # It requires less space.                                             # It requires more space.
      # ASCII is not standardized.                                          # Unicode is standardized.
