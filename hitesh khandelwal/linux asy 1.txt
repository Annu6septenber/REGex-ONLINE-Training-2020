Ques 1 When we create user some hidden files are generated in the directory of the same user at that time.
       how is it done ?

Ques 2 Make subdirectories inside a parent directory by using single mkdir command ?

Ques 3 tac command vs cat command ?


Ans 1  when we create a new user then all the files from etc/skel are copied to the home of new user. 
       the command to view these files is ls -a

Ans 2 mkdir A A/B A/B/C

Ans 3 cat command is used to display the contents of file.
      from first line to last line.
      whereas tac command is also used to display the contents of file 
      but here last line appears at top and first line appears at last.
