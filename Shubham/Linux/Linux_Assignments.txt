========================================================================================================================================
Assignment 1:                                           

Ques1.) When we create a user, some hidden files are generated in the directory of the same user at that time. How is it done?

Ans1.) UNIX allows users to have files which are not listed, by default, by the ls command. These are called hidden files and are 
      distinguishable from other files by the fact that their filenames begin with a dot (.). Such a file is .profile which is executed 
      every time you log in to the system. Hidden files are listed by adding the -a option to the ls command.The useradd is a low-level 
      utility for adding users. The useradd command only creates the user since it is a low-level utility for adding a user. We will  
      have to create the directory for the user explicitly in /home directory. While the command adduser will add users to the system 
      according to command-line options and configuration information in /etc/adduser.conf. It will automatically create a directory for 
      a user in the /home directory. Also when we check the /etc/passwd file then the last field, that is, the user shell for ‘adduser’ 
      is bash (/bin/bash) and for ‘useradd’ it is sh (/bin/sh). Also, adduser is a friendlier frontend to useradd and will do things like 
      creating user directories by default. This is why it doesn't show on frontend utility and therefore kept hidden i.e in the home 
      directory.
     

Ques2.) Make sub directories inside a parent directory by using single mkdir command. (refer to the figure given)
 
Ans2.)  mkdir -p A/{dir1,dir2,B/{C/dir3}}   (-p for parent directoy option).


Ques3.) tac command vs cat command ?

Ans3.)Cat Command: Cat Command, an acronym for Concatenate, is one of the most used commands in Linux systems. This Command is used to 
      read/print the contents of a file on your terminal. We can view multiple file content at the same time.
        	  Syntax: cat filename
		                cat filename1 filename2
      Tac Command: On the other hand, a lesser-known and less used command in Linux systems is Tac Command. This is used to print files 
      in reverse order. Tac is practically the reverse version of cat command (also spelt backwards) which prints each line of a file 
      starting from the bottom line and finishing on the top line to your machine standard output.
	          Syntax:  tac filename

Assignment 2:                                           

Ques1.) Change the Umask value for any user permanently.

Ans1.) Linux is a multiuser network operating system where the same Shell is being accessed by several users. 
        To provide a customized version of the same Shell to everyone (user, script or process), a layer is inserted between 
        actual shell and end-user. In this layer, several configuration files are used to create a user-specific environment. 
        Permanent umask setting is also configured in this layer. Based on the requirement, umask setting can be configured 
        in multiple levels. To configure umask setting correctly, we have to understand how the shell is being accessed. 
        A shell can be accessed in two ways; login and non-login.         
<<Login shell>>
        This is the shell environment which the user receives just after the login. It provides a customized interface to interact with    
        the system. It takes input command from the user and displays the result on the standard output device. The command prompt which user 
        receives just after the login is an example of a login shell.       
<<non-login shell>>
        This is the additional Shell interface which user accesses from login shell to perform a specific task. 
        Since it is accessed from a login shell, it inherits all customized properties of parent (logged in) shell. 
        But at the same time, it is also a separate shell which allows us to override the default properties.
        Any terminal which we open in GUI to execute the command is the example of a non-login shell.               

Based on targeted user and shell access type, permanent umask setting can be configured in four files.       
        ```grep umask /etc/bashrc		      // This sets for non login shell.
              umask 002```

        ```grep umask /etc/profile	      	// This sets it for login shell.
              umask 002```


Ques2.) Add a new user without using adduser & useradd command
 
Ans2.)  Steps for adding a new user without using adduser & useradd command:
     • Add an entry for the user in `/etc/passwd` file.            
     • Add an entry for the group in `/etc/group` file.             
     • Create the home directory for the added user.              
     • Set the new user password using the passwd command.     


Ques3.) Can we change the Umask value to 0888. 
          •If yes, then how. If not then why ?

Ans3.) We can setup umask in `/etc/bashrc` or `/etc/profile` file for all users. By default most Linux distro set it to 0022 (022) or 0002 (002).            
  •Open `/etc/profile` or `~/.bashrc` file, enter:           
      `vi /etc/profile`            
      `umask 022`           
  •Save this file. 
  ->Changes will take effect in the 'next login'.        
     

Ques4.) How to add a new user with a Unique user id (e.g 1345) & check out the unique

Ans4.) We can use :                           
	              ``` sudo useradd -u 1345 <username>
       To check the ID we  can use :
	              id -u <username>```


Ques5.) How to change the group of any folder. 
            • After this checkout the group name of the files present in that folder. 
            • Try to change the group of the folder & the files present in the same folder using a single command
            
Ans5.) The chgrp command changes the group ownership of given files.          
            ```chgrp [OPTIONS] GROUP FILE```             
       GROUP, name of the new group or the group ID (GID).                                  
       Numeric GID must be prefixed with the + symbol. FILE.., name of one or more files.             
          To checkout the group name:                
            ```
	                users <username>
            eg:	users Shubham
	              id -g -n Shubham	primary group
	              id -G -n Shubham	secondary group
            ```
        Also we can use:                    
            ```
               	grep <username> /etc/group
            eg:	grep Shubham /etc/group
            ```
       To change group with a single command use :                   
            ```
              	chgrp <options>  <group>  <file or fies>  
            ```

Assignment 3:                                           

Ques1.) Create & compress the file with bzip2.

Ans1.) Bzip2 is a well known compression tool and it’s available on most if not all the major Linux distributions. We use:
	                  sudo apt install bzip2
                  	bzip2 option(s) filenames		            #Creation
                  	bzip2 -z filename			                  #Compress
                  	bzip2 -z linux.tar		                	#Compress a tar file.
  

Ques2.) What should be the argument to be given to unzip that file.

Ans2.) Use unzip:
	            sudo apt install unzip
	            unzip backup.zip
  
  
Ques3.) Read a file & show the data on terminal using file input & output redirection

Ans3.) Use command:
	              gedit file.txt		                    #Type the required info
	              cat file.txt
	              echo Name >>file.txt
  
  
Ques4.) How to change the shell of user to “/bin/sh” at the time of adding the user

Ans4.)  useradd -s /bin/sh <username>
            eg:	useradd -s /bin/sh Shubham
