Assignment 1:                                           

Ques1.) What is JPython & CPython.

Ans1.) The default implementation of the Python programming language is Cpython. As the name suggests Cpython is written in C language.
       Cpython compiles the python source code into intermediate bytecode, which is executed by the Cpython virtual machine. CPython is
       distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and Python. It interact efficiently with large data sets, 
       e.g. using multi-dimensional NumPy arrays.
       - It quickly build your applications within the large, mature and widely used CPython ecosystem.
       - It integrate natively with existing code and data from legacy, low-level or high-performance libraries and applications.
       
       Jython is an implementation of the Python programming language that can run on the Java platform. Jython programs use Java 
       classes instead of Python modules .Jython compiles into Java byte code, which can then be run by Java virtual machine. Jython 
       enables the use of Java class library functions from the Python program. Jython is freely available for both commercial and 
       non-commercial use. 
     
          
Ques2.) Basic difference between Python2 & python3
 
Ans2.)  Difference between Python2 & python3:
                    It is more stable and transparent version of python programming language.It is the future of Python designed to 
        address the design flaws in the previous versions. The print-syntax is treated as a statement rather than a function which 
        requires text to be wrapped in parenthesis.The print is explicitly treated as a function and replaces by the print() function in
        python3 which requires an extra pair of parenthesis. ASCII string type is used by default to store strings.Unicode is the 
        implicit string type by default.It simply returns an integer to the nearest whole number when dividing two integers.It makes 
        integer division more intuitive using true division for integers and floats.

        Python2:
                Python 2 is an old open source version.
                    Function print :
                        print "hello"
                          eg:   def main():
                               print "Hello World!"
  
                       if __name__== "__main__":
                            main()

        Python3:

        Python 3 supports modern techniques like AI, machine learning, and data science
        Python 3 is supported by a large Python developer's community. Getting support is easy.
        Its easier to learn Python language compared to earlier versions.
        Offers Powerful toolkit and libraries
        Mixable with other languages.
        
            Function print:
            print ("hello")

          eg:  def main():
              print("Hello World!")
  
              if __name__== "__main__":
                main()


Ques3.) Difference between ASCII & unicode

Ans3.) ASCII defines 128 characters, which map to the numbers 0–127. Unicode defines (less than) 221characters, which, similarly, map to
       numbers 0–221 (though not all numbers are currently assigned, and some are reserved).

       Unicode is a superset of ASCII, and the numbers 0–128 have the same meaning in ASCII as they have in Unicode. For example, the 
       number 65 means "Latin capital 'A'". Because Unicode characters don't generally fit into one 8-bit byte, there are numerous ways
       of storing Unicode characters in byte sequences, such as UTF-32 and UTF-8.

       C follows ASCII and Java follows UNICODE.
