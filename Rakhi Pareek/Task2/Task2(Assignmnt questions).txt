Ques 1:Change the umask value permanently ?
Ans : This can be achived by writting a new Umask value in your shell’s configuration file (~/.bashrc for Bash) or in the /etc/profile file.

Ques 2:Add a new user without using adduser or useradd commands

Ques 3:Can we change the UMASK value to 0888?
Ans: No we cannot change the value of UMASK to 0888 because maximum value of UMASK can be 0777.
if we try to do so than we will get the following error:
rp@rp-virtual-machine:~$ umask 0888
bash: umask: 0888: octal number out of range
rp@rp-virtual-machine:~$ 


Ques 4: New user with unique user id
Ans : We can create new user with unique userid with ‘-u‘ option. For example, the following command will create a user ‘superuser‘ with custom userid ‘888‘. 
And also we can verify the user with the command cat /etc/passwd | grep superuser.
Code:
rp@rp-virtual-machine:~$ sudo -i
[sudo] password for rp: 
root@rp-virtual-machine:~# useradd -u 888 superuser
root@rp-virtual-machine:~# cat /etc/passwd | grep superuser
superuser:x:888:1003::/home/superuser:/bin/rp
root@rp-virtual-machine:~#
