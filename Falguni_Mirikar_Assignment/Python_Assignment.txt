						Assignment 1

Q1. What is JPython & CPython.

Answer. The default implementation of the Python programming language is Cpython. As the name suggests Cpython is written in C language. Cpython compiles the python source code into intermediate bytecode, which is executed by the Cpython virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and Python.

Jython is an implementation of the Python programming language that can run on the Java platform. Jython programs use Java classes instead of Python modules .Jython compiles into Java byte code, which can then be run by Java virtual machine. Jython enables the use of Java class library functions from the Python program.

Q2. Basic difference between Python2 & python3

Answer. Python2:

Python 2 is an old open source version.
Function print :
	print "hello"
Eg:   def main():
  print "Hello World!"
  
if __name__== "__main__":
  main()

Python3:

Python 3 supports modern techniques like AI, machine learning, and data science
Python 3 is supported by a large Python developer's community. Getting support is easy.
Its easier to learn Python language compared to earlier versions.
Offers Powerful toolkit and libraries
Mixable with other languages.
Function print:
print ("hello")

Eg:  def main():
  print("Hello World!")
  
if __name__== "__main__":
  main()


Q3. Difference between ASCII & unicode

Answer.  ASCII defines 128 characters, which map to the numbers 0–127. Unicode defines (less than) 221characters, which, similarly, map to numbers 0–221 (though not all numbers are currently assigned, and some are reserved).

Unicode is a superset of ASCII, and the numbers 0–128 have the same meaning in ASCII as they have in Unicode. For example, the number 65 means "Latin capital 'A'".

Because Unicode characters don't generally fit into one 8-bit byte, there are numerous ways of storing Unicode characters in byte sequences, such as UTF-32 and UTF-8.

C follows ASCII and Java follows UNICODE.

						Assignment 2

Q1. 3+4 **6-9*10/2

Answer. 4054.0

Q2. Let's say we have a string : "Hello this side regex". Find out the count of total vowels.

Answer.  str1="Hello this side regex"
	l=str1.lower()
	vc={}
	for i in "aeiou":
		count=l.count(i)
		vc[i]=count
	print(vc)


Q3. Find area of the triangle and take input from user for base and height.

Answer. 
	print("Enter the base",end="")
	b=float(input())
	print("Enter the height",end="")
	h=float(input())
	area=0.5*b*h
	print("Area is : ",end="", area)


Q4. Print the calendar on the terminal only if user enters the year.

Answer.    import os
	print("Enter the year")
	year=int(input())
	print(os.system cal -y year)
