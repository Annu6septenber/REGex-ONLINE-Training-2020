						Assignment 1:

Q1. When we create a user, some hidden files are generated in the directory of the
same user at that time. How is it done ?

Answer. UNIX allows users to have files which are not listed, by default, by the ls command.
These are called hidden files and are distinguishable from other files by the fact that their 
filenames begin with a dot (.). Such a file is .profile which is executed every time you log in 
to the system.
Hidden files are listed by adding the -a option to the ls command.The useradd is a low level 
utility for adding users.
Also adduser is a friendlier frontend to useradd and will do things like create user 
directories by default.
This is why it dosen't show on frontend utility and therefore kept hidden i.e in the home directory.

Q2. Make subdirectories inside a parent directory by using single mkdir command
(refer to the figure given)

Answer. mkdir -p A/{dir1,dir2,B/{C/dir3}}
   
Q3.tac command vs cat command

Answer. Cat command, acronym for Concatenate, is one of the most used commands in *nix systems. 
The most basic usage of the command is to read files and display them to stdout, meaning to display 
the content of files on your terminal.
On the other hand, a lesser known and less used command in *nix systems is tac command. 
Tac is practically the reverse version of cat command (also spelled backwards) which prints each line 
of a file starting from the bottom line and finishing on the top line to your machine standard output.


						Assignment 2

Q1.Change the Umask value for any user permanently.

Answer. Linux is a multiuser network operating system where same Shell is being accessed by several users. 
To provide a customized version of same Shell to everyone (user, script or process), a layer is inserted between 
actual shell and end user. In this layer several configuration files are used to create a user specific environment. 
Permanent umask setting is also configured in this layer. Based on requirement, umask setting can be configured 
in multiple levels. In order to configure umask setting correctly, we have to understand how shell is being accessed. 
A shell can be accessed in two ways; login and non-login.

Login shell
This is the shell environment which user receives just after the login. It provides a customized interface to interact with system. 
It takes input command from user and display the result on standard output device. The command prompt which user receives 
just after the login is example of login shell.

Non-login shell
This is the additional Shell interface which user accesses from login shell to perform a specific task. 
Since it is accessed from a login shell, it inherits all customized properties of parent (logged in) shell. 
But at the same time it is also a separate shell which allows us to override the default properties.
 Any terminal which we open in GUI to execute the command is the example of non-login shell.

Based on targeted user and shell access type, permanent umask setting can be configured in four files.

grep umask /etc/bashrc		This sets for non login shell.
umask 002

grep umask /etc/profile		This sets it for login shell.
umask 002

Q2.Add a new user without using adduser & useradd command

Answer. The one possible way is,

Add an entry for the user in /etc/passwd file.
Add an entry for the group in /etc/group file.
Create the home directory for the added user.
Set the new user password using the passwd command.

Q3.Can we change the Umask value to 0888.
○ If yes, then how. If not then why ?

Answer. We can setup umask in /etc/bashrc or /etc/profile file for all users. 
By default most Linux distro set it to 0022 (022) or 0002 (002). 
Open /etc/profile or ~/.bashrc file, enter:
vi /etc/profile
umask 022
Save this file. Changes will take effect in the next login.

Q4. How to add a new user with a Unique user id (e.g 1345) & check out the unique
Id of that user.

Answer. We can use : sudo useradd -u 1345 <username>
               To check the ID we  can use :
	id -u <username>

Q5. How to change the group of any folder
○ After this checkout the group name of the files present in that folder.
   Try to change the group of the folder & the files present in the same folder
   using a single command

Answer. The chgrp command changes the group ownership of given files.
	chgrp [OPTIONS] GROUP FILE
	GROUP, name of the new group or the group ID (GID). 
	Numeric GID must be prefixed with the + symbol. FILE.., name of one or more files.
To checkout the group name:
	users <username>
eg:	users matt
	id -g -n matt	primary group
	id -G -n matt	secondary group
Also we can use:
	grep <username> /etc/group
eg:	grep matt /etc/group

To change group with a single command use :
	chgrp <options>  <group>  <file or fies>  


						Assignment 3



Q1. Create & compress the file with bzip2.

Answer. Bzip2 is a well known compression tool and it’s available on most if not all the major Linux distributions.
 We use:
	sudo apt install bzip2
	bzip2 option(s) filenames		#Creation
	bzip2 -z filename			#Compress
	bzip2 -z linux.tar			#Compress a tar file.

Q2. What should be the argument to be given to unzip that file.

Answer. Use unzip:
	sudo apt install unzip
	unzip backup.zip

Q3. Read a file & show the data on terminal using file input & output redirection

Answer. Use command:
	gedit information.txt		#Type the required info
	cat information.txt
	echo Name >>information.txt


Q4. How to change the shell of user to “/bin/sh” at the time of adding the user
	
Answer.  
	useradd -s /bin/sh <username>
Eg	useradd -s /bin/sh Matt
