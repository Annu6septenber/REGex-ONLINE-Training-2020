ques:-how to unzip bzip2 files.
ans:-we can't use the tar command because the archive isn't a .tar file. 
To uncompress a bzip2 file, use the following command but this won't preserve the original .bz2 file.
bzip2 -d file.xml.bz2
If we want to extract it and keep the original then we should run this command.
bzip2 -dk file.xml.bz2
